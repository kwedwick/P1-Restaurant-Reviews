#### user interface
* ASP.NET Core MVC web application
* separate request processing and presentation concerns with MVC pattern
* strongly-typed views
* minimize logic in views
* use dependency injection
* customize the default styling to some extent
* keep CodeNamesLikeThis out of the visible UI
* has only display- and input-related code

#### data access
* class library
* contains EF Core DbContext and entity classes
* contains data access logic but no business logic
